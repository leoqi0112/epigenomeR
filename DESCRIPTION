Description: A comprehensive R package for analyzing epigenomic data including ChIP-seq 
    and CUT&Tag experiments. Provides functions for count matrix processing, quality 
    control, clustering analysis, differential region identification, motif enrichment, 
    fragment decomposition, and advanced visualization including heatmaps and scatter 
    plots. Supports limma-voom pipeline for differential analysis and integrates with 
    RNA-seq data for multi-omics comparisons.
